# Welcome to my weather app

# How to run this locally
1. Make sure that `yarn` is [installed](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
2. `cd` into `weather-app`
3. run `yarn install`
4. Add a .env file, then add an Open Weather API key as so: `REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=<API_KEY>`. This key must subscribe to One Call. If not, the 7 day forecast will not load.
5. run `yarn start`
6. Enjoy the simple, yet fully functioning weather app!
